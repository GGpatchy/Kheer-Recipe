    <h2><u>Instructions:</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and Soak the Rice:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Rinse the rice thoroughly in water until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>Soak the rice in water for about 20-30 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Boil the Milk:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a heavy-bottomed pan, bring the milk to a boil on medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent it from burning at the bottom.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Add the Rice:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the soaked and drained rice to the boiling milk.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat and cook, stirring continuously to avoid sticking. Let the rice simmer and cook in the milk for about 30-40 minutes, or until the rice is soft and the milk has thickened. Stir every few minutes to avoid scorching.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Add Sugar and Flavors:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Once the rice is fully cooked, add the sugar and mix well. Let it dissolve completely.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed cardamom and saffron strands (along with the soaked milk, if using).</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Optional Garnish:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a separate pan, heat 1-2 tbsp ghee and lightly fry the chopped nuts and raisins until golden brown. Add this to the kheer.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Thicken and Serve:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Cook for another 5-10 minutes until the kheer reaches the desired consistency. You can add condensed milk at this stage for extra creaminess if desired.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and add a few drops of rose water for fragrance, if using.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Cool and Serve:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Kheer can be served hot, warm, or chilled. Garnish with extra nuts and saffron strands before serving.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
